Car Price Predictor

Project overview

A simple Car Price Predictor that estimates the selling price of used cars using a machine learning model (Linear Regression). The project includes a Python-based model training pipeline and a lightweight user interface built with HTML, Bootstrap (CSS) and JavaScript. Developed and tested in PyCharm.

Features

Train a Linear Regression model to predict car prices.

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling as needed).

Model evaluation with metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

Simple, responsive frontend for entering car attributes and viewing price predictions.

Clear project structure and scripts to train the model and run the application locally.
